f: A->B, f is bijection. a', a" in A.

f: A -> B
decomposition f: A ->> A/~ =~ im f => B

The formula defines a f~,
we have to verify:
that formula does define a function.
that fuction is in fact a bijection.

the equivalence class

2.1.  How many different bijections are there between a set S with n elements
and itself? [Â§II.2.1]
A: n!

2.2.  Prove statement (2) in Proposition 2.1. You may assume that given a family
of disjoint subsets of a set, there is a way to choose one element in each member of
the family. [Â§2.5, V.3.3]

f: A -> B exist right inverse g
<=> f is surjective.

=>:
for every b in B:
  f(g(b)) = b

let a = g(b)
then it means there exists a in A, which:
  f(a) = b

<=:
for every b in B, there exists a -> A, fits f(a) = b
define a set V:
  V = {(a,b)|a in A, b in B, f(a) = b}

pick up every identical b in V, form a set Vb
g =


2.3. Prove that the inverse of a bijection is a bijection, and that the composition
of two bijections is a bijection.

2.4.  Prove that â€˜isomorphismâ€™ is an equivalence relation (on any set of sets).
[Â§4.1]

means the â€˜isomorphismâ€™ set S.
reflexive: idA is isomorphism.
symmary: f is bi, f-1 is also bi.
transitive: f: A->B is bi, g: B->C is bi, then f o g: A->C is also bi.

2.5.  Formulate a notion of epimorphism, in the style of the notion of monomorphism
seen in Â§2.6, and prove a result analogous to Proposition 2.3, for epimorphisms
and surjections. [Â§2.6, Â§4.2]

monic: a', a": Z -> A. f: A -> B. f o a' = f o a" => a' = a"
f is monic <=> f is injective

prof.  =>
f(a'(x)) = f(a"(x)) => a' = a"
let
  b' = a'(x), b" = a"(x)
a' = a" => b' = b"
so f(b') = f(b") => b' = b"
f is injective

a'(f(x)) = a"(f(x)) => a' = a"
prof.  <=
microscopic portion Z = {p}, a', a": Z -> A
f o a' = f o a"
f(a'(p)) = f(a"(p))
(X) f is injective => a'(p) = a"(p) => a' = a"
(O) g o (f o a') = (g o f) o a' = idA o a' = idA o a" = (g o f) o a" = g o (f o a")

epic: f: A -> B. g: B -> C, im g = C => im(g o f) = C
f is epic <=> f is sujective

2.6. With notation as in Example 2.4, explain how any function f : A â†’ B
determines a section of Ï€A.

2.7. Let f : A â†’ B be any function. Prove that the graph Î“f of f is isomorphic
to A.

2.8. Describe as explicitly as you can all terms in the canonical decomposition
(cf. Â§2.8) of the function R â†’ C defined by r â†’ e2Ï€ir. (This exercise matches one
assigned previously, which one?)

2.9.  Show that if A âˆ¼=
A and B âˆ¼=
B, and further Aâˆ©B = âˆ… and Aâˆ©B = âˆ…,
then A âˆªB âˆ¼=
A âˆªB. Conclude that the operation AB (as described in Â§1.4)
is well-defined up to isomorphism (cf. Â§2.9). [Â§2.9, 5.7]
2.10.  Show that if A and B are finite sets, then |BA| = |B||A|. [Â§2.1, 2.11, Â§II.4.1]
12The reader should also be aware that there are important variations on the operations we
have seen so farâ€”particularly important are the fibered flavors of products and disjoint unions.
